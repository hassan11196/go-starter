# Go Starter
Basic Hello World Programs for Go.
  
  
### Run a Go Program:

    go run hello-world.go
### Create a Binary:

    go build hello-world.go
    
    


### Work-space directory structure

A Go workspace must have three sub-directories.

    /bin --> binary exectutables generated by go install
    /pkg --> Compiled Package Objects
    /src --> Source Code
    
  
 - package object save compilation time. 3rd party packages are also installed in /pkg directory.
 - go install creates packages objects of any imported packages. go install internally calls go build

### Installing Third Party Package:

    go get github.com/jinzhu/gorm

###  Creating Binaries for Workspaces :
	
    /*
    This Requires setting up the GOPATH and GOBIN environment variables. 
    where 
    GOPATH = .../GoWorkspaceName
    GOBIN = .../GoWorkspaceName/bin
    */
    go install hello
	/* 
	Above command will build main/src/hello/main.go 
	A binary file will be generated inside bin directory with the name of the package.
	 */
